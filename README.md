# Udacity Neighborhood Map Project

by Despoina Sakoglou

Location: Thessaloniki, Greece

--- Description

Thessaloniki, Greece, is an ancient Greek city which today is the second largest city in Greece and a popular tourist destination. There are many neighborhoods and central locations where you can shop local food, also called "meze" by the locals, have drinks with friends in the local taverns, and enjoy ancient ruins from the fallen ancient kingdom that the modern city in build on. In this project, I selected a few important highlights that every tourist should try and visit while they stay in Thessaloniki, and I display them in an interactive way in the website to make it easier to navigate for the user. 

The list of highlights can grow even further without extra maintanance and adjustment cost in the rest of the codebase due to the javascript abstractions used, which makes the website's content easier to grow and re-newed.
