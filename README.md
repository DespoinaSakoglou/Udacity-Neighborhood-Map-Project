# Udacity-Neighborhood-Map-Project
Thessaloniki, Greece, is an ancient Greek city which today is the second largest city in Greece and a popular tourist destination. There are many neighborhoods and central locations where you can shop local food, also called "meze" by the locals, have drinks with friends in the local taverns, and enjoy ancient ruins from the fallen ancient kingdom that the modern city in build on. In this project, I selected a few important highlights that every tourist should try and visit while they stay in Thessaloniki, and I display them in an interactive way in the website to make it easier to navigate for the user.
